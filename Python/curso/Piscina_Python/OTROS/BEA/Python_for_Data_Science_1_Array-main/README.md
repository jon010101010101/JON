# Python_for_Data_Science_1_Array
Exercise 00
Your function, give_bmi, take 2 lists of integers or floats in input and returns a list of BMI values. Your function, apply_limit, accepts a list of integers or floats and an integer representing a limit as parameters. It returns a list of booleans (True if above the limit). You have to handle error cases if the lists are not the same size, are not int or float...

Exercise 01
Write a function that takes as parameters a 2D array, prints its shape, and returns a truncated version of the array based on the provided start and end arguments. You must use the slicing method. You have to handle error cases if the lists are not the same size, are not a list ...

Exercise 02
Write a function that loads an image, prints its format, and its pixels content in RGB format. You have to handle, at least, JPG and JPEG format. You need to handle any error with a clear error message

Exercise 03
Create a program that should load the image "animal.jpeg", print some information about it and display it after "zooming".

â€¢ The size in pixel on both X and Y axis

â€¢ The number of channel

â€¢ The pixel content of the image.

â€¢ Display the scale on the x and y axis on the image

If anything went wrong, the program must not stop abruptly and handle any error with a clear message.

Exercise 04
Make a program which must load the image "animal.jpeg", cut a square part from it and transpose it to produce the image below. It should display it, print the new shape and the data of the image after the transpose.

Exercise 05
You need to develop 5 functions capable of applying a variety of color filters to images, while keeping the image shape the same.

You have some restriction operators for each function: (you can only use those given, you donâ€™t have to use them all)

â€¢ invert: =, +, -, *

â€¢ red: =, *

â€¢ green: =, -

â€¢ blue: =

â€¢ grey: =, /

The evaluation errors have been fixed it but, you should do your job and test, check eveything!!. ðŸ˜‰
