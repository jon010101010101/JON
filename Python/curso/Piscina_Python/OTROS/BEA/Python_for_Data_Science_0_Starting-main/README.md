Exercise 00
Exploring basic data objects

Exercise 01
Write a script to print time in a specific format

Exercise 02
Exploring object types

Exercise 03
All types of NULL in python

Exercise 04
The Even and the Odd

Exercise 05
Program, with a main, which takes a single string argument and displays the sums of its upper-case characters, lower-case characters, punctuation characters, digits and spaces

Exercise 06
Part 1:

Recode your own ft_filter, it should behave like the original built-in function (it should return the same thing as "print(filter.doc)"), you should use list comprehensions to recode your ft_filter.

Part 2:

Create a program that accepts two arguments: a string(S), and an integer(N). The program should output a list of words from S that have a length greater than N.

• Words are separated from each other by space characters.

• Strings do not contain any special characters. (Punctuation or invisible)

• The program must contain at least one list comprehension expression and one lambda.

• If the number of argument is different from 2, or if the type of any argument is wrong, the program prints an AssertionError.

Exercise 07
Make a program that takes a string as an argument and encodes it into Morse Code.

• The program supports space and alphanumeric characters

• An alphanumeric character is represented by dots . and dashes -

• Complete morse characters are separated by a single space

• A space character is represented by a slash /

You must use a dictionary to store your morse code.

### The evaluation errors have been fixed except for the EOF of ex05, which I have decided to leave as PASS.
